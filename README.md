# Social-Network-API

The porpuse of this project is to get hands on experience with MongoDB, a popular choice for social networks. 
In this project, I try to build an API for a social web application where users can share their thoughts.
I will use Express.js for routeing, MongoDB for the database and the Mongoose ODM. 

To test this application, I used Insomnia.
